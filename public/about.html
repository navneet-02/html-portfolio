<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Coming on to my interests, I really like watching cricket and nowdays I try to be well versed with whatever happening around the world. In my idle time, I am mostly reading news articles regarding politics, technology, business etc or watching cricket clips on you tube.</p>

<p>I am someone who likes to add value to my life by constantly reminding myself to upkill and make most of every single day.</p>
